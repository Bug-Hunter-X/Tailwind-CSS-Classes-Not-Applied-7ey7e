# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly. The bug involves a simple div element with Tailwind classes that fail to render the expected styles. The solution involves verifying the Tailwind CSS setup and build process.

## Bug

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple div element with several Tailwind CSS classes.  The styles defined by these classes are not applied when the code is executed.  This can be due to various reasons, including incorrect configuration, missing build steps, or issues with the Tailwind directives.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version where the Tailwind CSS classes are correctly applied. The solution typically involves:

1. **Verifying Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Ensuring that the `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and pointing to the correct CSS file and content paths.
2. **Building the CSS:**  Confirming that the Tailwind CSS build process is correctly executed to generate the necessary CSS output.
3. **Importing the CSS:** Making sure the generated CSS file is correctly imported into the application.
4. **Purge Options (if applicable):**  Ensuring the `purge` option in `tailwind.config.js` is configured correctly to include the necessary files that contain your classes, preventing unexpected purging behavior.
5. **Checking for Conflicts:** Ensuring there are no conflicting CSS rules overriding Tailwind's styles.

This example provides a practical demonstration of a common Tailwind CSS issue and its solution.
